Q2 Develop procurement management plan 
Current market analysis In the current market, Vr shopping project of Taobao is the pioneer of a new way of shopping. In the market, almost no other merchants adopt such a way of shopping, which is a very good situation for Taobao. For the time being, no competitors can develop ahead of schedule in this field. In addition, because of the rarity of this new way of shopping, Taobao will attract more customers and short video traffic, which can obtain good reputation and money feedback in the market.Suppliers selection matrix Suppliers name Purchasing overview Basic supplier requirements Leasing Equipment Company

Q4  
The figures used in Earned Value Analysis provide measures to indicate the status of a projectl incorporating measures for time, cost and scope. The key values are Earned Value, Planned Value and Actual Cost. The following calculations have been made for a project:
Budget at Completion (BAC)        $290,000
Time Estimate                           12 months
Earned Value (EV)                       $65,000
Planned Value (PV)                      $80,000
Actual Cost (AC)                          $79,000
a) Calculate cost and schedule variances, cost and schedule performance indices, estimate to complete, estimate at completion and to complete performance index           (5 marks)
b) What do these figures (varirance, performance indices and estimates) indicate?      (10 marks)
c) If you are the Project Manager, what actions would you take based on these figures?         (5 marks)
A)
SV: 65000-80000= -15000 
CV:65000-79000= -14000 
SPI:65000/80000= 0.81 
CPI:65000/79000= 0.82 
ETC:(290000-65000)/0.82= 274390.24 
EAC:79000+274390.24= 353390.24 
To complete performance index: (290000-65000)/(290000-79000)= 1.07 
B) What the variance tells you is the difference between the actual value and the estimated value. It can help the project manager to understand the specific situation of the project implementation such as not exceeding the time budget or the cost budget. The main purpose of the index is to calculate schedule performance and cost performance to determine whether you are ahead of schedule or behind schedule, over budget or under budget. Estimate is mainly used to measure whether the total project budget earns more money and whether there is more effort.C) If I am the project manager, I will learn that there are many problems in the development of the project through these data, and I will make some adjustments to this problem. Firstly, I will communicate and communicate with stakeholders to reduce costs as far as possible, encourage project members to make greater efforts to improve work efficiency, and formulate more perfect implementation system to reduce unnecessary losses. If these are successfully completed then the end result of the project may be improved.
